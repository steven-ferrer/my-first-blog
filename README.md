# my-first-blog

I haven't added much to the site yet.
All it does is display posts.

Check out the site here:

  http://stevenferrer.pythonanywhere.com/

It's live now using PythonAnywhere.

You can add post here:

  http://stevenferrer.pythonanywhere.com/admin/

Just login using this credentials:

  username: tester
  password: tester!@#$%

Don't worry, you can't mess around with it because it has limited permissions. 
All you can do is add posts ;)
